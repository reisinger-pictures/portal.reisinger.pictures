# Technical Concept: Downloads & Leak Tracing

## 1. ExifTool Metadata Injection
- To trace leaked high-res images without using visible watermarks, the `DownloadController` dynamically manipulates the file before delivery.
- The name of the downloader (e.g., "Max Mustermann" or "Gast") is injected into the `SpecialInstructions` IPTC field of the JPEG.
- The copyright notice is also forcefully re-applied based on the photographer's profile settings.

## 2. Watermarking (Fallback)
- If an unprivileged user (guest) accesses a public gallery, a visible SVG watermark is rasterized and stamped onto the image (via `Imagick`).
- To prevent heavy CPU load during mass-downloads, the rasterized SVG is cached in resolution "buckets" (`master_{width}.png`, e.g., `master_500.png`).

## 3. Public ZIP preparation concurrency
- Unauthenticated ZIP downloads of public free-download galleries are limited to one active request per client IP. A concurrent request from the same IP receives HTTP 429 with a German retry message; the lock covers preparation and streaming and is released on completion or failure.
- Authenticated ZIP downloads are not subject to this per-IP lock. Existing route-level rate limiting remains in force.
- There is no photo-count or byte-size cap: one very large public gallery still incurs the cost of one complete ZIP preparation.
- ZIP preparation uses a unique scratch file for each scaled photo, tier, and request so concurrent preparations cannot overwrite or consume each other's intermediate image.
